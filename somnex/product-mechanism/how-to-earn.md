# How To Earn

### How To Earn

There are multiple ways to earn on Somnex.

### 1) Provide liquidity

#### Perp Pools (SPLP) — single-sided USDC

* Deposit USDC to back perp markets.
* Earn a share of trading fees and borrow fees paid by traders.
* No impermanent loss; returns vary with market activity and utilization.

#### V3 — Concentrated Liquidity

* Choose a pair and set an active price range.
* Earn fees when trades happen inside your range; requires management.

#### V2 — Volatile Pools

* Provide both tokens across the full curve; simpler but subject to impermanent loss on volatile pairs.

#### Steps

1. Go to Earn → + Add Liquidity.
2. Pick Perp | V3 | V2.
3. Select token(s), amounts (and range for V3); review APR/fee tier.
4. Approve tokens and Confirm.
5. Track positions under My Pools.

### 2) Trade perps

* Long/short with up to 50× leverage; use Market/Limit/Trigger, TP/SL.
