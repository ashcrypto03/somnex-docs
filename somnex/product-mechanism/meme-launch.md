# Meme Launch

### Meme Launch

Launch new tokens in one click on Somnex. Creators can mint a token, run a bonding‑curve sale, and have the token auto‑listed on Somnex Swap when the curve completes.

### How it works

* Create: choose token name, ticker, and upload a logo.
* Bonding curve: tokens sell along a curve; the progress bar shows completion.
* Auto‑list: after the curve completes, the token appears on Somnex Swap for trading.
* Vesting (optional): built‑in vesting options for team allocations to improve trust (claim any time/any amount during the vesting).

### Launch a token (steps)

1. Go to Meme → Launch token.
2. Fill in token details (name, ticker, logo), optional (social links, website).
3. Review terms and confirm the creation transaction.
4. Share your token page; the bonding curve sale will begin.
5. After completion, trading starts on Somnex Swap.

### Discover & trade

* Use tabs: New, Trends, Listed, and Leaderboard to browse tokens.
* Check the contract link and socials before trading.

### Best practices & cautions

* Verify contract addresses and beware of impersonations.
* Creators should communicate vesting, supply, and utility transparently.
* There is no KYC per provided notes; evaluate risk before participating.
