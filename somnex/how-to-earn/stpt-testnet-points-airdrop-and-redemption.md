# STPT Testnet Points (Airdrop & Redemption)

To celebrate early adopters, Somnex is airdropping 1,000 Somnex Testnet Points (STPT) to wallets that interacted with Somnex on testnet.

`STPT redeem to 1000 mainnet points after launch.`

### STPT Overview

* Amount: 1,000 STPT per eligible wallet.
* Purpose: reward early users and map testnet participation to mainnet value.
* Weight: 1 Testnet Point = 1 Mainnet Point (same weight).

### Airdrop Rules

#### 1) Eligibility

* Any wallet that interacted with Somnex testnet.

#### 2) Non-transferable token

* The 1,000 STPT are a special Somnia testnet token and cannot be transferred.

#### 3) Claim process

Claim on the Somnex Quest (testnet) page by connecting your wallet to check eligibility. Portal: [https://testnet.somnex.xyz/#/quest](https://testnet.somnex.xyz/#/quest)

#### 4) Unlocking & Redemption

* To fully redeem your 1,000 STPT as Mainnet Points, earn 100 Mainnet Points by completing tasks after mainnet launch.
* After earning 100 mainnet points, your balance becomes 1,100 points (100 mainnet + 1,000 unlocked STPT).

### Snapshot & Claim Timing

* First snapshot: July 11, 2025 at 00:00 UTC.
* Ongoing: snapshots occur every 7 days. Stay active and track progress.

### How to Get Started (testnet)

1. Go to https://testnet.somnex.xyz and connect an EVM wallet.
2. Make at least one interaction on Somnex: swap a token, place a perp trade, or provide liquidity.
3. Open the Quest page and follow the claim flow if eligible.

### Unlock the Full Value (mainnet)

* You receive 1,000 STPT (locked).
* Earn 100 Mainnet Points via real tasks after mainnet launch.
* Redeem and unlock the full 1,000 STPT into Mainnet Points (1:1).

### Why It Matters

* Positions you for a future mainnet airdrop tied to points.
* Encourages real use of Somnex and helps test the platform.
* Boosts eligibility for future incentives and campaigns.

### STPT Claim — FAQ

#### 1) How do I get STPT?

Make at least one transaction on Somnex during testnet (swap, perp trade, or provide liquidity) and claim via Quest if your wallet is included in a snapshot.

#### 2) Who’s eligible?

* Any wallet that interacted at least once before the snapshot time.
* Already claimed before? Still eligible under snapshot rules (1 claim per wallet).

#### 3) How do points work on mainnet?

When mainnet launches, new users start at 0. Early users with STPT start with 1,000 points locked. Completing 100 mainnet points worth of tasks unlocks those 1,000, so you’ll show 1,100 total points.
